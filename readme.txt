Summary:
For the final, we created our own website using Python flask and html.
Our website contains three pages.
The first page is the main page. In this page, there is a profile picture
of me, my grade, my major, a link to my favorite website, and links
to the other two pages.

The second page is an assignments page. In this page, I write a brief
summary of each assignment we did in this class. At the end, I also write
a small paragraph on what assignment was my favorite.

The third page is a classes page. In this page, I list all the classes
I am taking this semester. I also write a small paragraph on which
class was my favorite so far.
